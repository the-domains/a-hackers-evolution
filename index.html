</article><p>A new scandal currently unfolding around the U.S. government’s relationship with the Big Data private sector is generating a shock wave from the users. Though what caught my attention in particular is the widespread misunderstanding of the technologies
    people use daily and the confusion about the relationship they have with these companies.</p><p>From a national security perspective an intelligence apparatus should be considered defunct if it does not make great use of such a fertile source of intelligence. Someone could think that “terrorists” or “bad people” know better by not making use of
    such technologies, but you will be surprised to know that the overwhelming majority of harmful intent cannot take on any size that is of any meaningful significance without relying on at least one or more of the technologies provided through the companies
    that have been involved in said scandal.</p><p>Though as everything else there will always be a 1% of competent adversaries that are well funded and well organized; they rely on technologies and systems they evolved or trust. <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nics.tennessee.edu%2Fleetaru&amp;t=MjcyOTA1Y2E2ODA2ZmFiNDdjZmQ3OGM4NDliZGViYTViMWZmOTc1MCxnVEwzRGlWVQ%3D%3D">At the current rate of advancements in science and technology; even the 1% will have a harder time in the near future to be as elusive as their predecessors</a>    but the theme should generally still remain a cat-mouse chase.</p><p>On a not entirely different hand; Big Data is still very valuable to be stored as some blob to satisfy <em>privacy</em> issues, understanding the dynamic and complex relationships in data and information is still needed more than ever if we wish to truly
    integrate with the technology we create to enhance the core experience of our existence. I can envision a future where mere intentions drive the economy, and to do that we will have to have a deep understanding of the human condition in order to be
    able to make any meaningful extrapolations.</p><p>That being said; I’m still a strong advocate against putting every individual under the government’s microscope, it’s dangerous and can be abused in very real ways. But the core issue here is our vague notions of what<em>privacy</em> is; for example you
    cannot possibly ask the government for <em>privacy</em>while operating a drug cartel as the government is responsible for the well-being of its citizens, alas it is philosophically much more complicated – what is justice? In fact, the real reason
    we demand <em>privacy</em> or anonymity is due to our insecurities, societal forces, or a justified fear of the system unjustly turning against us.</p><p>The human population has grown to such a size and developed sufficient technological proficiency that the ludicrous scenario of a government implementing a draconian regime is asymptotically equivalent to a government digging its own grave. No such government
    can possibly prolong or scale to apply an iron fist on an entire population using the technology of today without the people using the same technology to undermine the government itself – as evident by all the authoritarian regimes that have fallen
    just in the past few years.</p><p>The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) is expecting a new toy by September this year, a $2 billion dollars <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fthreatlevel%2F2012%2F03%2Fff_nsadatacenter%2Fall%2F1&amp;t=Y2E1ZDUxODU0OGY2Mzc4MjMxZDNhODUwYmY5MzI5N2VlMWYzZmUwZCxnVEwzRGlWVQ%3D%3D">Utah Data Center</a>    to support the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI). A yottabytes-scale – a trillion terabytes – storage and analysis facility that resides on one million square feet and requires 65 megawatts per year to operate. If anything this
    is a clear sign that given the progression of technology user’s will have to be more visible and take the Internet and technology in general more seriously. Your presence, actions, and identity on the ether are no more an afterthought; the separation
    between the virtual and the physical is now more elusive to define than ever.</p><p>So what is the answer to all of this? Do we keep on fighting the good and yet counterproductive fight? Or should we surrender to big government and kiss our liberties good bye to a new era of a police state? I do not know how to solve this trust-control
    conundrum without facing the mutual exclusivity that is national security and human liberties. Mutual exclusivity, that sounds too rigid to be true, there must be an acceptable compromise, isn’t there?</p><p>I think there’s a compromise. We have to understand that in order to upkeep our national security we will have to learn to be more intelligent in dealing with the technology, and by extension the government using technology more wisely and transparently.
    Demanding anonymity or<em>privacy</em> is simply asking too much to maintain national security given today’s challenges.</p><p>Though I think our liberties are still in our control, I’m rather intrigued that people feel less in control with all the power of today’s technology; we share a lot more information about our lives – quite unique information I might add – than ever before,
    it is the sense of value towards the information we share is what we need to develop. Of course we cannot expect everyone to be an information security expert to understand the value of every piece of information they share, but we should encourage
    using the right terminology for the technologies we use to instill a real sense of what a particular technology does and what it should be used for.</p><p>We assigned the name of “social networking” to technologies like Facebook, Google+, Twitter, etc. That is rather a side-effect function of what these services are, the true nature of these technologies or tools is information collection and dissemination.
    They give you the ability of viral reach and easier than ever monitoring and information gathering on people that you are interested in. Same applies for most of the technologies we use, they are either used to share or collect information, it’s the
    nature of the Internet.</p><p>Since nothing is <em>free</em> these services expect you to understand that they are at liberty to rigorously study whatever you put or get from their networks. It is a research project funded by the users in return for a digitized and advanced method
    of communication. Hopefully they will anonymize the data and information before they study it, but that’s pointless against a persistent adversary or a government as the cumulative information – assuming an effort of anonymity – you share still acts
    as a fingerprint-like signature.</p><p>So I think it all boils down to the decision of sharing a particular piece of data or information which is the real control of privacy we have. Any other sense of privacy is in essence delusional. The minute you click on that send button on an email,
    the share button on a “social networking” site, or hit the enter/new-line key on an IRC client; you no longer control the fate of that piece of information. The mere action of using a plain-text or a weakly encrypted channel will render the intended
    anonymity or privacy of anything you transmit on these channels void.</p><p>After all it seems that a simple and proper security diet can get us a long way, but how will that diet scale to the eventual merge of technology in the fabric of our lives remains a mystery to me. What do you think?</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="14"><!-- react-empty: 15 --></div></section><section id="section-v_ArticleTitle2x-184e27ff-6628-4c49-bace-a7a9037767d6"
